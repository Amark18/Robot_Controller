## Purpose
I wanted to use Arduino for a project and so I decided to make a simple robot that is controlled by an application. In addition, I wanted to use 3-D printing for this project 
and decided to use it for constructing the base. I liked making this project because I was able to make the put together the hardware and control it using software.
